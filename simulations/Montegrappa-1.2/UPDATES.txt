=================================================
	NEW FEATURES AND UPDATES 
=================================================


+) The functions needed to work with several chains are now properly implemented
 
+) SHELLS

This routine implements a neighbour-lists algorithm, based on the distance between atoms.
The number of pairwise interactions computed during each MC step can be reduced, leading to a speedup in terms of computing time.

To enable this feature, three new parameters must be included in the parameter file (.par)

- shell 1          -> to enable the feature
- nshell [int]     -> to set up the shell updates (every [int] steps)  
- r2shell [double] -> to specify the shell radius

[ Example ]

shell	1
nshell	1000
r2shell	6.0

 
+) ROTATION MOVE

This new move performs rotations around a random axis (x,y,z) passing through the center-of-mass of the chain (fastly computed on the backbone atoms coordinates).

The move can be performed adding the keyword "moverot" in the parameter file (.par) 

- moverot [int]

The move amplitude can be modified acting on the value of "dtheta" 
- dtheta [double]

[ Example ]

moverot	100
dtheta	0.25 

+) LOCAL MOVE

This new move performs local updates. A loose constraint is applied to a multiple pivot, generated from a collection of torsional angles sampled from
a conformational-biased gaussian distribution (Giorgio Favrin, Anders IrbÃ¤ck, Fredrik Sjunnesson "Monte Carlo Update for Chain Molecules: Biased Gaussian Steps in Torsional Space" J. Chem. Phys. 114 (2001) 8154-8158).

To enable the move, add to the parameter file (.par)

-movebias [int]    
-nmul_local [int]  -> local segment length
-bgs_a	[double]   -> an amplitude parameter
-bgs_b	[double]   -> a parameter to control the bias degree
