| TUTORIAL N. 3: parallel tempering w/o optimization of the potential |
\*********************************************************************/


Now we will use the MPI-version of MonteGrappa to run a short parallel
tempering simulation of a small hairpin, namely residues 41-56 of protein G
(1PGB.pdb), and calculate its specific heat as a function of the temperature 


Run
	/path/where/is/grappino hairpin.in


to create hairpin.pol and hairpin.pot; then run the MPI-version of MonteGrappa
	mpirun -np 8 /path/where/is/montegrappa_mpi hairpin.pol hairpin.pot hairpin.par 


At the end of the simulation, you should have lots of files in your directory: 
- energy_procN.ene
- last_procN.pol
- traj_procN.pdb
where N is the index of the replica (0-7 in this tutorial). 


To calculate the specific heat of our hairpin, we need to use the energies of 
each replica. Then, have a look at the energies, e.g. with 
	gnuplot
	gnuplot> p "energy_proc0.ene" w l, "energy_proc3.ene" w l, "energy_proc7.ene" w l


To be sure we will use equilibrium energies, we choose to cut out the first 
10% of the results, namely 100 entries out of 1000:

	sed -e '1,100d' energy_proc0.ene > energy_cut0.ene

this having to be made for each replica.
Now there should be 8 new files in this directory, 
energy_cut0.ene
energy_cut1.ene
..
energy_cut7.ene


Now we can run the routine mhistogram by using the input file mhistogram.in
(The help of mhistogram can be obtain simply digiting
	./mhistogram
without any parameter)

	/path/where/is/mhistogram mhistogram.in


Have a look at the results:
	gnuplot
	gnuplot> p "results.dat" w l, "dumb_e.dat" w lp

to visually check the fit of energies vs temperature with a sigma function; then

	gnuplot> p "results.dat" u 1:4 w l

to visualize also the specific heat.
